<p><h3>Stable Sorting Algorithm: </h3> A sorting algorithm is said to be stable if two objects with equal keys appear in the same order in the sorted output as they appear in the unsorted input.</p>
<p><h3>Unstable Sorting Algorithm: </h3> A sorting algorithm is said to be unstable if there are two or more objects with equal keys which donâ€™t appear in same order before and after sorting.<p>

<p>Some sorting algorithms such as Insertion sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, etc. are stable by nature, and other sorting algorithms like Heap Sort, Quick Sort, etc. are not stable by nature.</p>
